### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use \u201cclass:\u201d instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a \u201chandle\u201d prefix, like \u201chandleClick\u201d for onClick and \u201chandleKeyDown\u201d for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=\u201c0\u201d, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, \u201cconst toggle = () =>\u201d. Also, define a type if possible.
